SONG LINEUP FOR LITURGY
==================================

** This branch is suspended and being replaced by a different branch **

This project is to develop a website to communicate weekly (music, and maybe at most other liturgical ministry) needs of a choir within its members

This is the 3rd version of the project.

The 2nd version is on the marionette branch. Its code is in production at multiple parishes.
One of those is at: http://flock.bluepego.com
